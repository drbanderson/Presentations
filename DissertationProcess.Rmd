## 

**Guiding Principles**

##

Your dissertation is **VERY** important to you.

To others, not so much.

## 

The best dissertation is a **DONE** dissertation.

## 

Successfully completing the dissertation demonstrates your fitness to conduct original scientific research in the entrepreneurship and innovation domain.

That's it.

##

This means that the dissertation *should not* be...

- The best work you ever do

- A grand theory of the firm

- Win you the first Nobel for an entrepreneurship researcher

##

A dissertation is really just a regular paper, but longer.

## 

**Bloch School/UMKC Logistics**

- Dissertation-related forms available on Slack

- Plan on having a rough-draft of your proposal to your Chair by Dec of your third year

- Proposal defense ideally at the end of your third year

- Committee makeup

##

**Things To Sweat**

- Your topic

- Your Chair

- Your workflow

- Research design and timelines

- Your proposal

##

**Things NOT To Sweat**

- The rest of your committee

- Money (maybe)

- Is my dissertation going to get published in a journal?

##

**Dissertation Formats**

Manuscript vs. Three-paper model

## 

**Choosing a Topic**

- Your dissertation is "who you know" and "what you are"

- Ideally your topic should overlap with your Chair's interests, or at least competencies 

- The value of "mini-proposals"

##

**Your Chair**

- Must be a department member with doctoral faculty status

- Have a meeting about expectations and timeliness UP FRONT
    - Discuss areas where you need more assistance than others
    - If you are someone who needs deadlines, say so
    - Your dissertation is one of many projects for your Chair, so you need to manage your expectations

- Ideally your workflow aligns with your Chair's workflow---bad things happen when you like to work one way and your Chair works another!

##

**Your workflow**

- Slow and steady wins the race

- Make your regular meetings with your Chair as productive as possible
    - Do send drafts 1-2 days **before** the meeting
    - Get your deliverables in **ON TIME**
    - Be clear about where you need extra help

- Copy editing services are FINE, editing services are NOT
    - It's not your Chair's job to fix your writing!

##

**Research design and timelines**

- Plan on 2-3 studies, so layout timelines accordingly

- Qualitative work is acceptable, upon approval of the Chair

- A mixture of exploratory and confirmatory modeling is fine, but exploratory only is not allowed

- Identify costs and budget requirements **EARLY** in the process

##

**Your proposal**

- No more than 50 pages

- Must follow SGS guidelines

- Chapters 1-3 of the dissertation

- This takes the **BULK** of the dissertation work

##

That's it!
