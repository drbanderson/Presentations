## 

How do you isolate the strategically relevant within a sea of noise and extreme uncertainty?

##

*Extreme uncertainty* is an environment where the direction, mangintude, and timing of change are functionally impossible to predict, as are the consequences of those changes.

##

Challenges to strategic decision making under *extreme uncertainty*...

* Signal-to-noise ratio
* Traditional market research and data collection is **exceptionally** difficult
* Harder to predict competitive responses
* Emerging constraints and shifting opportunities

##

How much will COVID-19 reshape the market for undergraduate business education in **Fall 2021**?

##

How Bloch is approaching this problem...

1. Decide on the performance metric that matters the most right now
2. Understand the difference between possible and probable
3. Embrace what you can control, and account for what you cannot

##

Step 1 -- Decide on the performance metric that matters the most right now

* Putting a temporal bound on the problem
* Relentlessly focusing on causal adjacency

## 

Breakout 1 -- What is the most important metric for univerisities to understand how COVID-19 is changing the undergraduate market in Fall 2021?

##

Discussion and agreement 

##

Step 2 -- Understand the difference between possible and probable

* This is a critical distinction, and subject to biases
* The ability to contextualize probabilities focuses attention on highly probable, and ideally important, variables

##

Breakout 2 -- What are things in the environment for undergraduate education that are likely to happen **and if they did happen**, would cause a substantial shift for Fall 2021?

##

Discussion and agreement 

##

Step 3 -- Embrace what you can control, and account for what you cannot

* To what extent are you able to shape---not control, but shape---your future value proposition?
* What are the variables you cannot control and what is the probability they will happen and effect your value proposition?

##

How much of a university's value proposition to undergraduates depends on the educational experience by itself, relative to other aspects of the student experience (living on-campus, athletics, student organizations, and so forth)?

##

Discussion

##

If you are not in a position to shape your value proposition in preperation for uncertainty subsiding, pivoting may be a viable---and crucial---option.

##

Recap for improving strategic decision making under extreme uncertainty...

1. Decide on the performance metric that matters the most right now
2. Understand the difference between possible and probable
3. Embrace what you can control, and account for what you cannot
