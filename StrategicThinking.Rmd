How do you separate the strategically important from the irrelevant in a sea of noise and cloud of uncertainty? How do you take the strategically relevant and use those insights to make better decisions in a rapidly changing environment? This session will focus on using systems thinking and Bayesian logic as a framework improve our strategic thinking. Through a large group session and small group breakout rooms, we will explore:

How to be better consumers of data and models to separate the signal from the noise
How to incorporate those signals into a picture of a strategic situation and identify sources of future uncertainty, to make better strategic decisions in the moment.


1. Decide on the performance metric that matters the most right now
2. Understand the difference between possible and probable
3. Relentlessly focus on causal adjacency
4. Embrace what you can control, and account for what you cannot

1. Brainstorm the performance metric that matters
2. What has likely changed, and what is in our control?
