## 

I made this presentation with R and R Studio. It's also posted on GitHub, [along with the code](https://github.com/drbanderson/Presentations).

##

You can do all sorts of things with R Studio, [like this](https://www.drbanderson.com).

##

[And this](https://dsom5509.github.io).

##

[And this](https://dsom5509.github.io/FilteringIllustration.html).

##

[And this](https://dsom5509.github.io/Session3TeamDeliverableSolution.pdf).

##

You can also create...

- MS Word documents
- MS PowerPoint presentations
- Books
- Handouts

##

You can also do a little statistics :)

##

It's all about the workflow...

##

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("DSWorkflowGraphic.png")
```

##

Why else should you use R and GitHub?

##

Replicability.

##

Reproducibility.

##

Transparency.

##

In my opinion, this is where we are going.

##

Head to https://rstudio.cloud/ and lets do some live coding :)
