I made this presentation with R and R Studio. It's also posted on GitHub, [along with the code](https://github.com/drbanderson/Presentations).

##

You can do all sorts of things with R Studio, [like this](https://www.drbanderson.com).

##

[And this](https://dsom5509.github.io).

##

[And this](https://dsom5509.github.io/FilteringIllustration.html).

##

[And this](https://dsom5509.github.io/Session3TeamDeliverableSolution.pdf).

##

You can also create...

- MS Word documents
- MS PowerPoint presentations
- Books
- Handouts

##

You can also do a little statistics :)

##

It's all about the workflow...

##

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("DSWorkflowGraphic.png")
```

##

Why else should you use R and GitHub?

##

Replicability.

##

Reproducibility.

##

Transparency.

##

In my opinion, this is where the field is going.

##

Head to https://rstudio.cloud/ and lets do some live coding :)

##

Git, GitHub, and version control.

##

Think of GitHub as both a collaboration tool, and as a backup tool. 

##

If you are not familiar with writing code, GitHub is going to seem pretty foreign, and potentially not worth the trouble.

##

My argument is that it is worth the trouble, because it enables workflow...

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("DSWorkflowGraphic.png")
```

How many of you have a folder on your computer with contents that look like this...

- 12Feb2018Data_Original.dta
- 12Feb2018Data_Working.dta
- 15Feb2018Data_JaneModified_V1.dta
- 15Feb2018Data_JaneModified_V2.dta
- 15Feb2018Data_V3_USETHIS.dta

For researchers, particularly when using R (or related platforms), GitHub is a way for research teams to collaborate on analyses (and writing papers) while keeping things organized and integrated.
